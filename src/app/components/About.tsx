      As a school psychologist-turned-software engineer, I leverage my deep
      understanding of human behavior and learning to craft intuitive and
      user-centric software solutions. Throughout my career, I&#039;ve honed the
      ability to analyze complex problems from multiple perspectives, allowing me
      to design software applications that meet diverse needs. My time in
      education has ingrained in me a sense of empathy and a commitment to
      creating inclusive and accessible technology.
      <br />
      <br />
      I thrive in collaborative environments where I can harness my excellent
      communication and teamwork skills to drive projects to success. Whether
      I&#039;m debugging code or conducting user research, my diverse background
      enriches my approach.
      <br />
      <br />
      Let&#039;s connect and explore how my unique skill set can bring value to
      your projects. Looking forward to engaging with like-minded professionals in
      the tech community!
